    question: "What is an air source heat pump?",
    answer: "An air source heat pump is a renewable heating system that extracts heat from the outside air and transfers it into your home. It works like a refrigerator in reverse and can provide both heating and hot water for your property."
  },
  {
    question: "How much can I save on energy bills?",
    answer: "Homeowners typically save 30-50% on heating bills compared to traditional systems. The exact savings depend on your current heating system, home insulation, and energy usage patterns."
  },
  {
    question: "Are there any government incentives available?",
    answer: "Yes, various government incentives are available to help offset the installation costs of heat pumps, including grants and rebate programs. Our team can provide you with the most up-to-date information on available incentives in your area."

  {
    question: "How long does installation take?",
    answer: "A typical installation takes 2-3 days, depending on the complexity of your property and whether you need additional work such as radiator upgrades or improved insulation."
